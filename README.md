A smart attendance system using python .
dataset folder will be created auto and a folder for each user images 
embeddings folder created auto in the same way
and a processed images folder + a an excel file contain the attendace record.below is project structure and guide.

Smart attendance management system:
A face detection attendance system build with pyhon programming language and Facial recognition technology .

**Requirements:**
- webcam resolution up to 720 to capture clear images
- Python IDE , OpenCV Face_recognition and NumPy libraries
- face recognition algorithm (reconize/detect  faces and extract facial features )
- Attendance management by manage records for each person (time and date)

Order of commands: 
step1:  dataset_creation.py (Capture images+user id or name for folder creation)
step2:  image_processing.py (optional process images)
step3:  face_embeddings.py (Generate face embeddings)
step4: attendance_system.py (Run attendance system)
step5:   export_to_excel.py (Expot attendance details  to excel)
